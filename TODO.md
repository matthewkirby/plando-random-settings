- Make a barebones GUI that uses a config file for names of things but checks and downloads rando when its opened and then has a button to generate a patch file
- Add browse buttons to select a rom and an output directory
- Allow preset choices (league, multiworld, beginner) that load the adjustment weights files.

- Should check if there are any new updates
- Should do something like hash the weights file and compare to something online


# Done
- Write functions that download correct version of rando (make sure it works on windows at least for now)
- Write function to generate a patch file from a plando given the downloaded version of rando using the CLI
- End to end, one click to download randomizer, make the plando, make the patch file
- Ways to turn off things like tricks, conditionals and starting items
